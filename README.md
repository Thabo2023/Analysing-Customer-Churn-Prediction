Aims:

Develop an accurate and interpretable model to forecast customer churn for a telecommunications company.
Identify at-risk customers to facilitate targeted retention strategies and improve profitability.

Key Findings:
Conducted an in-depth exploration of the Telco Customer Churn dataset, addressing missing values and data inconsistencies.
Cleaned and preprocessed data by encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical features.
Engineered new features to capture hidden patterns, enhancing predictive power.
Visualized key features and their relationships with churn, identifying correlations and patterns.
Trained and evaluated multiple classification models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
Logistic Regression emerged as the best model based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC.
Analyzed feature importance to interpret main drivers of churn, ensuring actionable and interpretable predictions.

Implementation and Insights:
Developed targeted retention strategies based on model insights to address churn risks.
Integrated the predictive model into the company’s CRM systems.
Provided recommendations for continuous monitoring and updating of the model.

Impact:
Enhanced ability to predict customer churn, enabling proactive retention efforts.
Improved customer satisfaction and loyalty through targeted strategies.
Reduced marketing costs by focusing on at-risk customers.

Future Directions:


Incorporate additional data points like customer interaction history and satisfaction scores.
Implement techniques like SMOTE to handle class imbalance.
Continuously update and retrain the model to maintain accuracy and relevance.Aims: Develop an accurate and interpretable model to forecast customer churn for a telecommunications company. Identify at-risk customers to facilitate targeted retention strategies and improve profitability.
